[1;91m[-] [0mOops, the program crashed with one of the test cases provided. There are
    several possible explanations:

    - The test case causes known crashes under normal working conditions. If
      so, please remove it. The fuzzer should be seeded with interesting
      inputs - but not ones that cause an outright crash.

    - In QEMU persistent mode the selected address(es) for the loop are not
      properly cleaning up variables and memory. Try adding
      AFL_QEMU_PERSISTENT_GPR=1 or select better addresses in the binary.

    - On MacOS X, the semantics of fork() syscalls are non-standard and may
      break afl-fuzz performance optimizations when running platform-specific
      targets. To fix this, set AFL_NO_FORKSRV=1 in the environment.

    - Least likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options
      fail, poke the Awesome Fuzzing Discord for troubleshooting tips.
